Requires Michael Foord's odict module, available at:
http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/odict.html

Right now, it's not that complicated. Copy the AwstatsReader directory to a
path in your sys.path.  On a unix-like system, that's probably
/usr/local/lib/python2.x/site-packages or /usr/local/lib/python2.x/dist-packages.

Copy awstats_cache_merge.py to somewhere in your $PATH (/usr/bin,
/usr/local/bin, $HOME/bin, etc)
