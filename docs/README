ABOUT THE MODULE
================
AwstatsReader is an attempt at a pythonic interface to AWStats data cache
files.  Using it, you can access year, month, and individual data points
via dictionary-like accessors.

DISCLAIMER
==========
This is a "release early, release often" release, codnamed Joshua-hopes-
somebody-downloads-this-and-likes-code-quality-and-hires-him.

This is an early release...probably pre-alpha.  There are no tests yet (haven't
generated cache files I can release publically), not much documentation,
and the interface may change (but I hope not too much).

And I haven't even put this in a public repository, as the name might (but
probably won't) change.

I wrote this via examples from an AWStats cache file, so I'm sure there are
sections for which I do not have definitions.  If you would send me those
sections, I'll be sure to add them.

The error handling is probably a little light.  Certainly could be improved.

Right now, this will parse and display cache files from AWStats 6.5. I've not
tested other versions yet, as 6.5 is the only version I've had access to so far.
