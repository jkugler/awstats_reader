TODO List

More/better error handling
More sections once I have more examples
Probably remove __section_cache as it really isn't needed
Check the version of the file, as the format of the sections may vary
Restructure the _section_format and _section_merge_rules into one dict
Pull the version number when reading file, write it to ouput
